Exercise 3: CGDB Commands
1. How do you pass command line arguments to a program when using gdb?
 - "run [arglist]" will start the program with the arguments in [arglist].
2. How do you set a breakpoint which only occurs when a set of conditions is true (e.g. when certain variables are a certain value)?
 - Enter "break [line #] [conditional expression]".
3. How do you execute the next line of C code in the program after stopping at a breakpoint?
 - Enter "s" or "n".
4. If the next line of code is a function call, you'll execute the whole function call at once if you use your answer to #3. (If not, consider a different command for #3!) How do you tell GDB that you want to debug the code inside the function instead? (If you changed your answer to #3, then that answer is most likely now applicable here.)
 - Enter "s" to step into the function
5. How do you resume the program after stopping at a breakpoint?
 - Enter "c" to continue running the program.
6. How can you see the value of a variable (or even an expression like 1+2) in gdb?
 - Enter "p expr" can show value of "expr"
7. How do you configure gdb so it prints the value of a variable after every step?
 - Enter "display x" will show the value of "x" in every step
8. How do you print a list of all variables and their values in the current function?
 - Enter "info locals" will show the value of all local variables.
9. How do you exit out of gdb?
 - Enter "quit" will exit the program
